# Mixed Messages Project

This project is one of the portfolio projects from Codecademy's Full Stack Path. The purpose of the project is to build a message generator in JavaScript where a user will get a randomized message every time they run
program. 

## Topic

The topic I used was Dad Jokes. I broke down dad jokes into four arrays: question (Who, What, Why), verbs (do, didn't, did), subjects, and answers. Utilizing a factory function, I stored the arrays in an object, and created
a message method to output the full question and an answer method to output the answer. Each element of the array is randomly chosen and then added to the template literal. 

## Project Objectives
1. Build a message generator program using JavaScript ✔️
2. Use Git version control ✔️
3. Use command line ✔️
4. Develop locally on your computer ✔️
